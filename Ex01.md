# IMPLEMENTATION OF SYMBOL TABLE 
## Register Number :212222040162
## Date : 12-08-2024
## AIM   
To write a C program to implement a symbol table.
## ALGORITHM
1.	Start the program.
2.	Get the input from the user with the terminating symbol ‘$’.
3.	Allocate memory for the variable by dynamic memory allocation function.
4.	If the next character of the symbol is an operator then only the memory is allocated.
5.	While reading, the input symbol is inserted into symbol table along with its memory address.
6.	The steps are repeated till ‘$’ is reached.
7.	To reach a variable, enter the variable to be searched and symbol table has been checked for corresponding variable, the variable along with its address is displayed as result.
8.	Stop the program. 
## PROGRAM
```
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

#define MAX_EXPRESSION_SIZE 100
#define MAX_SYMBOLS 15

int main() {
    int i = 0, j = 0, x = 0, n, flag = 0;
    void *add[MAX_SYMBOLS];   
    char b[MAX_EXPRESSION_SIZE], d[MAX_SYMBOLS], c, srch;

    printf("Enter the Expression terminated by $: ");
    while ((c = getchar()) != '$' && i < MAX_EXPRESSION_SIZE - 1) {
        b[i++] = c;
    }
    b[i] = '\0';  
    n = i; // Store the actual length of the expression

    printf("Given Expression: %s\n", b);
    printf("\nSymbol Table\nSymbol\tAddress\t\tType\n");

    for (j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        c = b[j];
        if (isalpha((unsigned char)c)) {  
            // Check if the symbol is followed by an operator or end of expression
            if (j == n - 1 || b[j + 1] == '+' || b[j + 1] == '-' || b[j + 1] == '*' || b[j + 1] == '=' || b[j + 1] == '\0') {
                if (x < MAX_SYMBOLS) {
                    void *p = malloc(sizeof(char));  
                    if (p == NULL) {
                        printf("Memory allocation failed\n");
                        return 1;
                    }
                    add[x] = p;
                    d[x] = c;
                    printf("%c\t%p\tIdentifier\n", c, p);  
                    x++;
                } else {
                    printf("Symbol Table limit reached.\n");
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    getchar();  // Consume any leftover newline character
    printf("\nEnter the symbol to search: ");
    srch = getchar();
    for (i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        if (srch == d[i]) {
            printf("Symbol Found\n");
            printf("%c @ Address %p\n", srch, add[i]);
            flag = 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    if (flag == 0) {
        printf("Symbol Not Found\n");
    }

    for (i = 0; i < x; i++) {
        free(add[i]);
    }
    return 0;
}
